				<b><i><u>Windows Device in User Space (RnD_Win_DUSE)</i></u></b><br>
				Developed a Device in user space to get access to block data from user space in I/O path. Currently, Windows doesn't have the mechanism to get access to block data from I/O path in the user space. This is similar to FUSE in Linux which provides an access to non-privileged user to create its own file system in user space.

				<br><br><b><u><i>Change Block Tracking for Hyper-V</i></u></b><br>
				The objective of this project is to build a Change Block Tracking driver which will keep track of changed blocks for virtual disks at run time (incremental backup). The product captures disk level backup of the guest OS installed on the hyper-visor. The backup application would trigger a snapshot event from which point onward all I/O operations needs to be captured.. The Pass-through mini-filter driver would trap all the I/O operations at file system level in (offset, length) format. This would then be converted to disk level (offset, length) format and sent back to the backup application.

				<b><i><u>Distance Vector Routing Protocol Implementation</i></u></b><br>
				A multithreaded application using UDP connection and socket programming in C#.
				The main idea is to find the minimum cost between each nodes combination in the system.<br>
				We have an input file where we keep the number of neighbors, the names of the neighbors, the port numbers of the neighbors. The input file basically acts as a forwarding table.<br>
				After every 15 seconds, we send out the current state of each node to all its neighbors. And, the receiving node will calculate the minimum cost to all the nodes, based on the received inputs from its neighbors.<br>
				I have used the <b>Bellman-Ford equation</b> to calculate the costs.<br>
				We can also edit the input file dynamically by updating the costs and the system will recalculate the costs and next hops based on the new values.
				<br><br>
				<u>Technologies Used:</u><br>
				• Languages – C#<br>
				• Tools – Visual Studio 2015<br>
				<br>
				<u>Details of work done:</u><br>				
				• Completed the whole project individually as a part of the course ITCS 6166: Computer Communications and Networks.<br>
				• Implemented a command-line application for the protocol.<br>
				
				<br><br>
				<b><i><u>HTTP/1.1 Protocol Implementation</i></u></b><br>				
				The objective of this project was to implement the HTTP/1.1 request commands (GET and PUT) using client server framework.
				Socket programming was used to accomplish the task of communication between the client and the server. HTTP commands such as GET and PUT were used as the communication protocols.

				<b><i><u>Carpool Management System</i></u></b><br>				
				In a world with increased traffic and pollution because of increased vehicles, we had planned and proposed to share the resources efficiently by sharing the ride among people and saving fuel and money in the process.
				In this project, we have developed a Web application which will help its users to find out people who are travelling on the same route (Source and Destination) and same day (or flexible - up to the user), and collaborate with them in order to share a car.

				<b><i><u>Parallel Data Compression using LZMA</i></u></b><br>				
				Now-a-days a tremendous amount of data is generated and shared per second, so there is real need of efficient data storage management and utilization of bandwidth.<br>Data compression is one of solution to this problem. Compression ratio and time required for compression and decompression are two main pillars of data compression. If either of the two gets hampered then data compression may be termed as inefficient.
				<br>LZMA (Lample-Ziv-Markov) is one of the finest algorithms for data, to be more precise, text compression in terms of compression ratio. But we found that it has not got that much amount of success due to its comparatively high time complexity for compression. We have improved its time complexity by implementing it in a parallel fashion. 
				<br>GPGPU has provided a well-defined and economic path of parallel implementation to a computer community.
				<br><br>Here we have implemented a general data compression algorithm that has been designed by keeping in mind the parallel nature of the computing devices that we will be using. This, as we have discovered over the course of the project, not only decreases the compression time but also provides us with a compression ratio slightly better than that of LZMA.
				<br><br>
				<u>Technologies Used:</u><br>
				• Languages – C<br>
				• Keywords— LZMA, CUDA, lossless data compression, GPU, BZIP2, GZIP.<br>
				<br><br>
				
				<b><i><u>Bank management System</i></u></b><br>				
				In this project the user can create an account where it gets a unique account number, has the option to choose the type of account viz., saving, current. The user can deposit in the account, withdraw from it. It also includes simulation of ATM machine using applet. 
				<br><br><u>Technologies Used:</u><br> Java, JSP, JavaScript, Oracle 9i<br>
				<br><br>
				
				<b><i><u>Tender management System</i></u></b><br>				
				In this project the organizations can float their Tenders on a common platform, while the vendors will put out quotations for the available Tenders. Hence the organization can choose the perfect suitable quotation for their tender.

				<br><br><u>Technologies Used:</u><br> VB 6, Oracle 10g
